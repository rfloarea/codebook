# Codebook

I believe there is value in memorization and repetition. If it's good enough for the poets it's good enough for the coders.

I have to believe that if I run through examples of good-enough code over and over, I'll begin to actual learn the underlying principles. Sometimes it just takes a hundred repetitions before I understand.

This "codebook" is my notebook, my sketchbook, my exercise book, my place to come and do nothing new. Just my daily reps. This type of learning is in the body, and I think it's valuable.

## Organization

As I see it now, there are two categories: scripts and builds.

**Little Scripts**: < 100 lines

These are very simple scripts that individually do *something*. They may not even have practical applications. But they involve important building blocks of knowledge.

**Little Builds**: < 500 lines

These are very simple programs, but complete. I expect to be able to run through these builds in under an hour.

## Progress

I'll track my progress on which scripts/builds I've practiced, how long it took, and a brief description of the experience (learnings, etc.). I want to see what happens as I get faster and if I can start to spot areas to improve the starting code. To keep things level, I'll be sure to track progress per build version. I expect that I'll want to change the base builds I'm using as reference. When that is the case, I'll conclude my progress notes on that version and begin again; my progress reports will mirror the build versions.

## Tools

The whole point is to build muscle memory, so no extensive automated tools will be used (unless specified). I do see the value is building my skills at using certain tools (text editors in particular), but beyond that, it seems contradictory to involve automation in this practice. It be like using an automated car to learn how to drive. Doesn't make sense. But it is fine to learn to drive using a car with backup cameras, power steering, and the basic bells and whistles of a modern car.

I'll start out using VSCode because that's where I've been keyboarding the most. I'm curious about other text editors of course (they seem to be a special fascination of mine).
